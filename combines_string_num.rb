# Write a Ruby script that combines a string and a number. 
# It should create a string that includes a number in it through interpolation and then print it.

number = 2024

# interpolation
script = "The current year is: #{number}"

# Run Ruby combines_string_num.rb
puts script

# Output -> The current year is: 2024
